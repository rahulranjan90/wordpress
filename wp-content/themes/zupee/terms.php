<h3 class="terms-page-subtitle1">D.	Skill Based games played on Cashgrail�s application do not qualify as Gambling and Lottery</h3>
<ol class="terms-page-ol">
<li>Users must note that the Ludo Supreme Gold game hosted on the Cashgrail Platform is a game of skill, under Indian law, and that we do not support, endorse or offer to Users games of chance for money. While Games of skill do not have a comprehensive definition, they are considered to be those games where the impact of a players effort and skill on the outcome of a game is higher than the impact of luck and chance.
</li>

<li>Ludo Supreme Gold are a Games of Skill, as the outcome / success in the games is directly dependent on the Users effort, performance and skill. By choosing how to play, 
the actions of Users shall have direct impact on the game.</li>

<li>While, every game will have some elements of chance, the same may be substantially eliminated by using skills and knowledge of the game.</li>
<li>As per Section 2(3) of The Nagaland Prohibition of Gambling and Promotion and Regulation of Online Games of Skill Act, the definition of "Games of Skill" is reproduced as under:
"Games of Skill" shall include all such games where there is preponderance of skill over chance, including where the skill relates to strategizing the manner of placing wagers or placing bets or where the skill lies in team selection or selection of virtual stocks based on analyses or where skill relates to the manner in which the moves are made, whether through deployment of physical or mental skill or acumen�.
Explanation: For the purpose of this Act-All Games provided in Schedule A of this Act shall fall under the category of "Games of Skill". 'Games' which have been declared or determined to be �games of skill� by India or International courts or other statutes, or games where there are domestic and international competitions and tournaments, or games which can be determined to be �games of skill� shall further be entitled to be included in Schedule A. Games of skill may be (a) Card based and (b) action/virtual sports /adventure/ mystery and (c) calculation/Strategy/quiz based.�
</li>

 
<li>The Supreme Court of India in the case of Dr. K.R. Lakshmanan vs. State of Tamil Nadu and Anr on 12 January, 1996 reported at AIR 1996 SC 1153; 1996 SCC(2) 226 wherein the word Games of Skill has clearly been stated which is reproduced as under:
<br>

"A game of skill, on the other hand- although the element of chance necessarily cannot be eliminated � is one in which success depends principally upon the superior knowledge, training attention, experience and adroitness of the player. Golf, chess and even Rummy are considered to be games of skill. The Courts have reasoned that there are few games, if any, which consists purely of chance or skill, and as such games of chance is one in which the element of chance predominates over the element of skill, and a game of skill is one in which the element of skill predominates over the element of chance. It is dominant element � "skill" or "chance" � which determines the character of the game".

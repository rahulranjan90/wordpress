               <p>Responsible gaming means playing a disciplined game till the point it does not affect your body and mind. Every game has a break-even point. Playing a game as per the quiz rules, and understanding when to stop playing a game is called responsible gaming.
<br/><br/>
Following are the guidelines you should follow as a safe and responsible player:</p>
<h3><font color="ffffff">Do's</font></h3>
<p><ul><li><font color="#7da5d9">You should play Ludo Supreme with money that you can afford to lose.</font></li>

<li><font color="#7da5d9">You should decide in advance how much money you will spend playing the game and that money should not be a part of your previous game reserve.</font></li>

<li><font color="#7da5d9">You should complete all your personal and other important tasks before sitting to play so that you can play the game with a free mind.</font></li>

<li><font color="#7da5d9">You should also decide on the number of hours you will be devoting to the game.</font></li>

<li><font color="#7da5d9">You should always set deposit limits while playing so that you never deposit more than you can afford to lose.</font></li></ul><p>

<h3><font color="ffffff">Dont's</font></h3><p><ul><li><font color="#7da5d9">You should not play Ludo Supreme by taking loans.</font></li>
